This is the HomePage after logging in:

As you can see on the left we have different type of leaderboard, on the right we have a chat and in the middle we can participate to a game.

Then we have the page where we are searching for an opponent:

When we have found an opponent, we are ready to play.

After placing the boards, we have this page where we can see the opponent boards (in front of us), and then our board on the bottom of the page. As you can see, if we hit a boat we will see gray, red it's a generic boat and blue it's the sea. Below the board we have the chat where we can talk with the opponent.

We have also implemented a profile page where an user can see it's statistics

Also, for admin users, we have a section where we can manage users.

We have also generated an APK from the Angular code using Apache Cordova. This are some results
